# ExpressMap: A D3-based Gene Expression Heatmap

To demo ExpressMap:
- You need to have internet access. 
- In the repo's root directory, start the Python HTTP server:

```python python/runServer.py```

Then, you will be able to see the demo in a web browser at: 

```localhost:8000```

- You can also choose a different host name and port to run the demo:

```python python/runServer.py <hostname:port>```

Test data: 
- GTEx data: The top 100 expressed genes in blood. 
- Pre-computed gene and tissue dendrograms generated by python/cluster.py, which computes euclidean distance and uses the single-linkage clustering method.
